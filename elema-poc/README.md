# Elementary + React Flow PoC

TODO
- can the edge itself display control data or represent the signal?

- load/save patches

- sub patches w custom uis
    - like you should be able to play around then set your ins/out and wrap your thing with a custom ui so that its totally composable.
    - react component property editor? dont know if thats enough
    - save as compressed url a la https://nyman.re/mapdraw/#l=60.172108%2C24.941458&z=16 and https://textarea.my/

- editable programatic text view of signal flow (like that other cool app i saw)

- add tailwind and some standard gui controls - Dieter Rams style

- vst export


## things i want to build
- looper
- pitch shift
- record clip
- sampler
