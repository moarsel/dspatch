# Elementary + React Flow PoC

TODO
- think about then clean up signal vs. control flows
- I dont think we need control flows at all, look how elementary does it, much more elegant
    - https://www.elementary.audio/docs/reference/Math 

- clearer UI to represent signal 
    - el.scope, el.meter, el.fft, el.capture 
    - can the edge itself display control data or represent the signal?
